Hello Ousmane,
I wish you a happy and healthy new year!

Regarding the autoinstaller script. I both attach it in zip, but it is also on the primary server in:
/var/www/html/com/net-profil/subdomains/autoinstaller/
and I have created a db on the mysql server:
"autoinstaller" with the table "website"

You run the script by:
php auto_website_run.php
or:
php /var/www/html/com/net-profil/subdomains/autoinstaller/auto_website_run.php

The table needs those values:
domain: the base domain, ex: www.bizenco.com
alias: the alias domains, separated by whitespace - ' ': bizenco.com www.bizenco.fr bizenco.fr
ssl: 0 - do not install https, 1 - install https
directory: where the base dir of the   website is, ex: /var/www/html/com/net-profil/subdomains/demo5
status: here you control behaviour. Can get those values (case insensitive):
-- CREATE: it will try to create a new installation
-- DELETE: it will remove https certificate and delete apache conf files
-- EDIT: it will first delete, and then recreate the installation
-- OK: return status that the command was executed correctly
-- DELETED: in case of delete command, that the delete was successful. You can then remove the line (?)
-- ERROR:

errors: will contain the error message that halted the script execution.

Important notes:
- I tried to make the script "fail-safe" and automate. Even in error, it shouldn't stop the server, but in case of error, most likely a human should take a look.
- In case of HTTPS, we can request max 5 certificates per domain per week. So, if you create a webiste demo150.netprofil.com, with ssl, and edit it 5 times (remove/create), it will get an error, because each time it will request a new certificate. Then, you will have to wait 1 week, to reinstall the https certificate.
- In case of HTTPS, the website must NOT be locked. Else the installation will fail. After installation, you can password lock the website again.


Can we take a look into this together? I tested it and used
demo15.net-profil.com,
demo18.net-profil.com, 
demo20.net-profil.com,
demo21.net-profil.com,
demo22.net-profil.com,

I suggest you create a few create commands on the table, so I can verify we both understood the logic.

if you want to run a test, the command is:
php /var/www/html/com/net-profil/subdomains/autoinstaller/auto_website_run.php
